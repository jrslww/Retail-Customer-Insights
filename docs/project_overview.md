# Online Retail Behavior Analysis and Recommendation System

## Introduction
The Online Retail Behavior Analysis and Recommendation System is a comprehensive data engineering and data science project aimed at leveraging user behavior and transaction data to provide valuable insights for an online retail business, as well as to provide personalized product recommendations to customers.

## Project Goals
The project has two main objectives:

1. **Behavior Analysis**: Analyze customer behavior on the website, understand patterns and trends, and segment customers based on their behavior.

2. **Recommendation System**: Develop a recommendation system that provides personalized product recommendations to customers, thereby improving the shopping experience and increasing sales.

## System Overview
The system consists of several components:

1. **Data Collection**: User behavior data is collected in real-time from the website using event tracking. Transaction, customer, and product data are extracted from the company's database.

2. **Data Processing**: The raw data is cleaned, transformed, and stored in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**: Customer behavior is analyzed and customers are segmented based on their behavior.

4. **Machine Learning**: A recommendation system is trained using the processed data.

5. **API**: An API is provided to retrieve the product recommendations for a given user.

6. **Frontend**: A frontend interface displays the product recommendations to the user.
